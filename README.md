	Justification	
		- Our problem involves NLP and predictive modeling.  Jeff Coady has a background in linguistics, 
		- Chris Haddad has experience with predictive modeling, and Sanjay Roberts has some experience with both NLP and modeling.
		- Further, Sanjay Roberts has experience with Kaggle competitions and the rest of the team is anxious to learn about the process of competing.
	
	
	Problems/Motivation
		- Detect toxic comments and minimize unintended model bias
		- Our goal is to build a model that recognizes toxicity in comments and minimizes unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities.

	Libraries and Tools (What you already know and what else you need to evaluate)
		- Known Packages:
			+ matplotlib
			+ pandas
			+ tensorflow
			+ scikit-learn
			+ scipy
			+ imbalanced-learn
			+ keras
			+ ipython-autotime
			+ psutil
			+ nltk
			+ gensim
		- Potential Packages:
			+ elmo

	Data Collection
		- We will be using a Kaggle dataset.  The dataset is labeled for identity mentions and optimizing a metric designed to measure unintended bias. 
		- The dataset can be found here:

	Required work detail before build model
		- data cleansing
		- Tokenize and Pad
		- FastText Embedding

	What is the predictive task and model detail.
		- multinomial classification of toxicity classes
		- seeking to use ensemble methods
		- grid search 
		- k-folds
		- imbalance-learn
		
	Model evaluation and selection strategy.
		- k-folds for cross validation
		- Matthews Correlation Coefficient for accuracy
		- start with LSTM and CNN, move to ensemble
		- use kaggle submissions to test against other competitors
			+ retrain, resubmit to kaggle, evaluate rank, retrain, ...

	How a user is going to test the final model. is there any webpage/command line interface.
		- TBD
	
	Tentative time line of activities.
		- Week of April 22nd
			+ read literature
		- Week of April 29th
			+ make ML ready dataset
		- Week of May 6th
			+ test LSTM using grid search for hyper parameter tuning, k-folds for bias analysis
		- Week of May 13th 
			+ test CNN, grid search, k-folds
		- Week of May 20th
			+ begin testing ensemble learning method
		- Week of May 27th
			+ continue testing ensemble learning method
		- Week of June 3rd
			+ final submission to kaggle with best results
		- Week of June 10th
